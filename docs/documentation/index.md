# Basic Documentation

Everything you need to know about Navycut.

The documentation part for the Navycut framework is defined by all of the available layers.

Here we have tried to explain all of the layers of navycut for the better understanding.

## How the documentation is organized

Navycut has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

Tutorials take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a Web application. Start here if you’re new to Navycut or Web application development. Also look at the “First steps”.
Topic guides discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
Reference guides contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Navycut machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have a basic understanding of key concepts.
How-to guides are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Navycut works.

#### __The Model Layer__: 
Django provides an abstraction layer (the “models”) for structuring and manipulating the data of your Web application. Learn more about it below:
